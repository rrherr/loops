This is the [YouTube acoustic version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaVPupbNFAo). This version repeats the last lines of the 2nd verse and the bridge, but the original version doesn't. We'll sing it without the repeats, like the original version.

- [Chorus 1](#35.008,60.834)
- [Chorus 2](#105.601,131.667)
- [Chorus 3](#168.94,194.80)

```
        G         C     G    D
Lord, I need‚ÅüYou, oh, I need You

Em    C       G    D
Every hour, I need You

   G     C         G        C
My one defense, my righteousness

   G          D    G        C
Oh God, how I need You
```
