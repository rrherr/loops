[Verse 1](t:72.11,93.94)
Tell me, lover  
Now that you made your change  
Was your soul rediscovered?  
Was your heart rearranged?  
Are you still taking pills in the morning?  
And did you lose that longing now?  
For a walk through an ocean town  
'Cause this town's just an ocean now  

[Verse 2](t:93.91,115.75999999999999)
You don't hate the summers  
You're just afraid of the space  
Asking strangers for answers  
To forget what they say  
A boat beside a dock in the sunlight  
Nothing but the water and the sunrise now  
Just the lack of an open mouth  
'Cause this town's just an ocean now  

[Chorus 1](t:115.76,140.29000000000002)
Bad, I'll miss this place, your head and your heart  
And my dad still tells me when they're playing your songs  
Laughing at the way  
That you would say  
"If only, baby, there were cameras in the traffic lights  
They'd make me a star  
They'd make me a star"  

[Post-Chorus 1](t:140.29,162.10999999999999)
I wanna go to Maine, mmm  
I wanna go to Maine, oh  

[Chorus 2](t:162.11,186.65)
Bad, I'll miss this place, your head and your heart  
And my dad still tells me when they're playing your songs  
Laughing at the way  
That you would say  
"If only, baby, there were cameras in the traffic lights  
They'd make me a star  
They'd make me a star"  

[Post-Chorus 2](t:186.65,208.46)
I wanna go to Maine  
I wanna go to Maine, God  

[Verse 3](t:208.46,233.09)
Tell me, lover  
Once you've had your change of heart  
'Cause we're no more than the fossils  
On Crescent Beach State Park  
And we used to sing along to church bells on Sundays  
And can you even hear em from the subway now?  
And I hope that we make you proud  
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
