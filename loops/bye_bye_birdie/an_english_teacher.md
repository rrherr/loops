His going in the Army  
Is the best thing he could do  
Now you're free to start to do  
What you wanted to  
Albert, Albert, A - - Albert!  

I remember how you told me  
I should trust you for a year  
It would just be for a year  
But it's eight years, Albert!  
Eight long years, Albert!  

_"Rosie, it takes time to build a business!"_

It was only a sideline  
That's what you said  
You just needed some money  
That's what you said  
You were going to college, and get ahead  
Instead of being a music bus'ness bum  
You were going to NYU  
And become, an English teacher!

An English teacher, an English teacher  
If only you'd been an English teacher  
We'd have a little apartment in Queens  
You'd get a summer vacation  
And we would know what life means  

A man who's got his Masters  
Is really someone  
How proud I'd be if you had become one  
It could have been such a wonderful life  
I could have been Mrs. Peterson  
Mrs. Albert Peterson  
Mrs. Phi Beta Kappa Peterson  
The English teacher's wife!

_"Oh Rosie, I told you, as soon as I get a few bucks ahead..."_  

You said it before, Albert!  
And along came Conrad Birdie  
And it was goodbye, Geoffrey Chaucer  
Hello, William Morris  
Goodbye, NYU  
Hello Al-Mae-Lou  
'Cause, when you wrote Conard's first hit  
Agha-bagha-boo  
Then I knew, that was it  
You were through, with English  
Forever
