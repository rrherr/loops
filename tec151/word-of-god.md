[Verse 1](#9.25,38.51)

## No Capo

```
D           A      D           A
The Word of God is light in my darkness,


D            A         E          A
Hope for the hopeless, strong and true.


D           A      D                A
The Word of God is strength for the weary,


D            A         E        A
A shield for those who trust in You,


D            A         E        A
A shield for those who trust in You.
```
