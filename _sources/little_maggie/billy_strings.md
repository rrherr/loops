[Verse 1](t:14.67,40.95)
Over yonder stands... little Maggie  
With a dram glass in her hand  
She's drinkin' away her troubles  
While a-courtin' another man  

[Verse 2](t:67.013547,79.623547)
Well how can I ever stand it?  
Just to see them two blue eyes  
They're shinin' like a diamond  
Like a diamond in the sky  

[Verse 3](t:79.620377,92.110377)
Well sometimes I have me a nickel  
Well sometimes I have a dime  
Sometimes I have ten dollars  
I'm gonna pay little Molly's fine  

[Verse 4](t:118.682847,131.322847)
I'll march me down to the station  
With my suitcase in my hand  
I'm goin' away for to leave you  
I'm goin' to some far distant land   

[Verse 5](t:321.250557,334.080557)
Well pretty flowers were made for bloomin'  
Pretty stars were made to shine  
Pretty women were made for lovin'    
Little Maggie was made to be mine  

[Verse 6](t:334.308657,362.818657)
Go away, go away... little Maggie  
Go and do the best that you can  
I'm gonna get me another woman  
You can get you another man
