<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop1" value="14.67,40.95" />
<label for="loop1">Verse 1</label>
</strong></div>

Over yonder stands... little Maggie  
With a dram glass in her hand  
She's drinkin' away her troubles  
While a-courtin' another man  


<div><strong>
<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop2" value="67.013547,79.623547" />
<label for="loop2">Verse 2</label>
</strong></div>

Well how can I ever stand it?  
Just to see them two blue eyes  
They're shinin' like a diamond  
Like a diamond in the sky  


<div><strong>
<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop3" value="79.620377,92.110377" />
<label for="loop3">Verse 3</label>
</strong></div>

Well sometimes I have me a nickel  
Well sometimes I have a dime  
Sometimes I have ten dollars  
I'm gonna pay little Molly's fine  


<div><strong>
<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop4" value="118.682847,131.322847" />
<label for="loop4">Verse 4</label>
</strong></div>

I'll march me down to the station  
With my suitcase in my hand  
I'm goin' away for to leave you  
I'm goin' to some far distant land   


<div><strong>
<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop5" value="321.250557,334.080557" />
<label for="loop5">Verse 5</label>
</strong></div>

Well pretty flowers were made for bloomin'  
Pretty stars were made to shine  
Pretty women were made for lovin'    
Little Maggie was made to be mine  


<div><strong>
<input type="radio" name="loop" id="loop6" value="334.308657,362.818657" />
<label for="loop6">Verse 6</label>
</strong></div>

Go away, go away... little Maggie  
Go and do the best that you can  
I'm gonna get me another woman  
You can get you another man
