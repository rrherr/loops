[Intro](t:0.248417,10.726234999999999)

[Verse 1](t:10.369756,32.949756)
Road dogs are built for sleepin' in  
I've been up since 4 AM  
At your worst, you're better than my better days  
There ain't been no sun in L.A.​  
Since you moved out of Sarah's place  

[Verse 2](t:32.95,61.22)
I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid  
I heard you scored a job in the East Village  
Well, workin' for some folks who don't know your name  
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?  
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place  

[Chorus 1](t:61.22,83.34)
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline  
We always knew you were the better half of our good times  
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face  
Out at Sarah's Place  

[Guitar Fill](t:83.34,89.74000000000001)

[Verse 3](t:89.74,112.61999999999999)
And you called to talk just last week  
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be  
And your picnic chair is just sittin' there in the yard  
And I had to sell my old guitar  

[Chorus 2](t:112.62,134.99)
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline  
We always knew you were the better half of our good times  
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face  
Out at Sarah's Place  

[Bridge](t:134.99,158.8)
You'll always be a piece of mine, a piece of mine  
We drove that road we know at least a million times  
I'm so damn tired of seein' that empty drive  
Out at Sarah's Place  

[Chorus 3](t:158.8,181.02)
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline  
We always knew you were the better half of our good times  
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face  
Out at Sarah's Place  

[Guitar Solo](t:181.02,200.08)

[Outro](t:200.08,211.01000000000002)
Plane tickets have gotten awfully expensive  
But I got mine for the price of a Gibson
